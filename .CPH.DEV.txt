#50377 Explore adding the Boolean to filter to narrow out null/undefined in array#filter (closed pull)
#50387 Add BooleanConstructor as an overload to .filter to allow for easy type predicate filtering (inDiscussion)
#30621 narrow array type with .filter(Boolean) (marked as duplicate of #16655, although #16655 is more broad than #30621)

#56013 Adding an overload to .filter breaks specific inference with nested functions (related?)
#16655 Boolean() cannot be used to perform a null check (broader than filter(Boolean))
#29955 Allow Boolean() to be used to perform a null check (accepted pull, may have reverted)

From #29955
```
const nullableValues = ['a', 'b', null];
const values1: string[] = nullableValues.filter<string>(Boolean);
const values2: string[] = nullableValues.filter(Boolean);
```

Hmm, lets try with checker code change but no lib change first
