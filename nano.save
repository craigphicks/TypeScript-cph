The article says - <i>They include a 2021 that reduced the charges for certain robberies—not involving a weapon, and resulting in the loss of under $950—from felonies to misdemeanors</i>. That's SB-82, sponsored by Skinner, which hasn't passed yet. Some robberies would be converted to petty theft - <i>Petty theft in the first degree is taking property from the person of another or from a commercial establishment by means of force or fear without the use of a deadly weapon or causing great bodily injury.</i>


That means a robber only threatening or causing minor bodily harm would only be committing a misdemeanor.
